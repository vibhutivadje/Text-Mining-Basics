    "Initially we were happy with the product especially since we got it a very good price last Amazon Prime Day sale on July 16, 2018. We liked how we can watch and stream shows easily thru various apps like Netflix, Amazon video, Dramafever, Rakuten etc. Very lighrweight tv and just right for our needs. However to our surprise just awhile ago August 22, 2018, while streaming a drama series, the on screen display turned washed out/white screen. Turned on and off the tv several times to see if it will reboot/restart properly. Unfortunately nothing remedied it. Either you get back to that washed out screen or a totally black screen no apps at all. I have just submitted a replacement request thru Amazon customer service so we will see what happens and how fast they will address our complaint.\n",
    "Just an update, so we ended up being told by Amazon, to contact Best Buy and we did that by email at the same time indicating in the letter we want a replacement. Best Buy replied to us that it is outside of the return period if we want contact Toshiba directly. So, we did just that..with sheer frustration of course being tossed around. Toshiba nicely told me that they will send the techinician and I asked which company handle this techinician is it Toshiba or a third party. Ironically, they are coordinating with who else. The Geek Squad. Oh dear..back to Best Buy then. The Geek Squad guy came on the appointment date, just a few minutes late, but was nice enough. His assessment as discussed with whoever was on the other end of the line came down to an approval for a replacement. So we were asked to bring the tv over to our local Best Buy, gave us the confirmation and work numbers. Even gave us his business card and that of his manager if in case we encounter problems. For some reason it seems it is not common for them to service products sold by Best Buy throught the Amazon website.\n",
    "So we went to our local Best Buy. The lady was nice enough, and honest enough to say she was not familiar with an Amazon sale of a Best Buy product. So I had to tell her again the long story of how we got the tv etc etc. Finally someone helped her encode the return correctly and we had a store credit for the complete amount we paid for. However when we got the replacement tv, the price in store is slightly higher so we had to shoulder now the difference. Well, we just paid for it. So in short losing the advantage of that Prime deal sale price which did not work at all with a defective product. We do wish these three companies, Amazon, Best Buy and Toshiba iron out the way they handle requests for replacements and returns....seems initially both Amazon and Best Buy did not want to shoulder the return. If we had not insisted on availing the limited manufacturer's warranty, we would just have been left with a useless crap of a tv.\n",

    "text=\"I bought a laptop in September 2019. Something went wrong with the laptop and it was not starting at all. So i have to send it to Dell warehouse as they don't have any local representatives anywhere who will provide technical support. So i send the system back to the company. After checking they told me that few of the parts were damaged due to some liquid in it. Now. i remember that there was no incident happened with the system that the liquid have gone inside. Still when they told me that i have to pay for the parts i paid it. After taking the payment i got an email from the company after a week saying that they don't have parts in stock and it will take some time for them to receive it. So me left with no option have to wait for the parts to come in and the system getting repaired. The service was very disappointing. I requested them for a loaner system as it was because of them that the repair was getting delayed. But they clearly denied to provide me any kind of courtesy help. I received the system after 2 months. When i received the system it was giving me some error immediately after starting. So I called up the Dell technical team. I was on call with them for almost 2 hours 15 mins and I did everything they told me to do. Even we tried to format the system but due to problem the system was not getting formatted. So the technician again gave me one and only option that send us the system and we will repair it and give it back to you. No even after payment almost $1,200 i am unable to use the system since last more than 3 months and I don't know still how much longer. They have the worst service. This time also they gave me one and only option to send them the system. They didn't even had courtesy of saying that as this was our fault we will send someone on site inspite the guy was telling me to pay money and buy higher level warranty then only someone will come to my office to repair it.\"\n",
